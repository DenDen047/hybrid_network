# Hybrid Network

This open-source project, referred to as **HybridNetwork** aims to provide the scalable and extendable implementations of combining a spiking neural network (SNN) and an artificial neural network (ANN).
On one hand, this project enables a uniform workflow over SNNs, ANNs and cording layers leading to an in-depth understanding of the combination of SNN and ANN.
On the other hand, this project makes it easy to develop and incorporate newly proposed models, so as to expand the territory of techniques on hybrid network.

## Key Features

- Easy to combine the artificial, spiking and cording layers.
- Supports widely used benchmark datasets.
- Provides easy-to-use APIs for developing a new hybrid model.
